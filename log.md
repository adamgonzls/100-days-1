# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 17, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
1. JavaScript (60mins)
2. GatsbyJS (100mins)

**Thoughts:**
I am restarting ES6 for Everyone. It's good to go through these courses again as I can tell I comprehend more than I did last time. I also see functions available in JS that are available in other languages and it makes me think about opportunities I have in other projects to use them.
I later finished the GatsbyJS tutorial available on the Gatsby website. I worked with GraphQL a little bit more and with the final steps before taking a site live such as Auditing with Lighthouse. I found the manifest and related steps to be interesting.

## Day 1: August 26, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
1. WordPress (60mins)

**Thoughts:**
Even though I've writting a couple of plugins for production, I wanted to go through a more structured process of creating a plugin. I found this series of articles on [Torque](https://torquemag.io/) that are good resource. Tonight I'll probably go through the process again and create a new plugin for the website.

## Day 1: August 31, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
1. React (70mins)

**Thoughts:**
I'm redoing a lesson on React because I've been having trouble remembering the exact syntax for ReactDOM.render(). I know the basic layout but I keep on forgetting the exact way to enter the first argument. I studied `this.props`. Glad I went through it a 2nd time, definitely feel like I have a better grasp. Later, I'll go through `this.state`.
`ReactDOM.render(<ComponentName />, document.getElementById('app'));`
