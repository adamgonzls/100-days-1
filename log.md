# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 17, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
1. JavaScript (60mins)
2. GatsbyJS (100mins)

**Thoughts:**
I am restarting ES6 for Everyone. It's good to go through these courses again as I can tell I comprehend more than I did last time. I also see functions available in JS that are available in other languages and it makes me think about opportunities I have in other projects to use them.
I later finished the GatsbyJS tutorial available on the Gatsby website. I worked with GraphQL a little bit more and with the final steps before taking a site live such as Auditing with Lighthouse. I found the manifest and related steps to be interesting.
