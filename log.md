# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 17, 2019
**Today's Progress:**
1. JavaScript (60mins)

**Thoughts:**
I am restarting ES6 for Everyone. It's good to go through these courses again as I can tell I comprehend more than I did last time. I also see functions available in JS that are available in other languages and it makes me think about opportunities I have in other projects to use them.
